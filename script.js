// Pseduocode

// Player chooses to play rock, paper or scissors
// Computer responds with rock, paper, or scissors at random
// Win, lose, or tie determined for each player
// Scoreboard reflects wins, ties, and losses and play total for each player
// Repeat until dinner is ready

// Algorithm

// User prompted to enter R, P, or S input to begin play
// Browser logs an invalid input as necessary and prompts user to try again
// Computer responds with random output of R, P, or S and alerts user
// Results compared and win, loss, or tie allocated to user and computer

// Coding

// Play variables declared, i.e. R, P, S (const variables)
// Outcomes variables declared, i.e. W, L, T (const)
// Input validation - if statement (characters true, else false, prompt)
// Play comparisons setup, i.e. rock beats scissors - if/else (or switch)
// User prompted with result (function)
// User prompted with their play (incrementation)
// 'finished playing' ambiguous but defined here as end of first round

// Considerations

// would ternary operators in if/else statements help DRY coding?
